----------------------

- [ ] Refactor notebook analysis_proteins_domains.ipynb , so that I have a function
that generates every time the dataframe to use for extracting the reads per domain of each gene. 

    - I found it is better to generate the data as I use it , instead of loading oot from excel and to all annoying transformations to have the data as I want to be use for further functions. 

- [ ] Refactor notebook analysis_proteins_domains.ipynb , so that I have a function that generates the genomic locations , insertions per domain , etc.  

- [ ] Add test functions for the main functionalities
