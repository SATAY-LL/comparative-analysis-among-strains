        Input is a list of of paths where files can be found with the known essential genes.
        A default list is implemented using two files present in the same folder as this file.
        It is expected that the files contain genes in a single column and nothing else.

        Note when using the default files: The length of the output list exceed the number of known essential genes as the list sometimes contains both the standard name and the systematic name of a gene.
