BEM3	YPL115C	ART5	YGR068C		Positive Genetic	high-throughput	Bait				BioGRID	Kuzmin E, et al. (2018) PMID:29674565	Digenic interaction: Query allele name: ho-delta+bem3-delta; Array allele name: art5-delta (GI score = 0.092135, p-value = 0.00704; Digenic)
BEM3	YPL115C	BEM1	YBR200W		Positive Genetic	high-throughput	Hit				BioGRID	Fiedler D, et al. (2009) PMID:19269370	An Epistatic MiniArray Profile (E-MAP) analysis was used to quantitatively score genetic interactions based on fitness defects estimated from the colony size of double versus single mutants.  Genetic interactions were considered significant if they had an S score > 2.0 for positive interactions (suppression)  and S score < -2.5 for negative interactions (synthetic sick/lethality).
BEM3	YPL115C	BEM1	YBR200W		Positive Genetic	high-throughput	Hit				BioGRID	Costanzo M, et al. (2010) PMID:20093466	A Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) analysis was carried out to quantitatively score genetic interactions based on fitness defects that were estimated from the colony size of double versus single mutants. Genetic interactions were considered significant if they had an SGA score of epsilon > 0.08 for positive interactions and epsilon < -0.08 for negative interactions, and a p-value < 0.05.
