BEM1	YBR200W	AAH1	YNL141W		Positive Genetic	high-throughput	Bait				BioGRID	Costanzo M, et al. (2010) PMID:20093466	A Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) analysis was carried out to quantitatively score genetic interactions based on fitness defects that were estimated from the colony size of double versus single mutants. Genetic interactions were considered significant if they had an SGA score of epsilon > 0.08 for positive interactions and epsilon < -0.08 for negative interactions, and a p-value < 0.05.
BEM1	YBR200W	AIM44	YPL158C		Positive Genetic	high-throughput	Hit				BioGRID	Hoppins S, et al. (2011) PMID:21987634	An Epistatic MiniArray Profile (E-MAP) approach was used to quantitatively score genetic interactions based on fitness defects estimated from the colony size of double versus single mutants.  Genetic interactions were considered significant if they had an S score >= 2.0 for positive interactions (epistatic or suppressor interactions) and S score <= -2.5 for negative interactions (synthetic sick/lethal interactions).  The authors constructed a mitochondrial-focused genetic interaction map (the MITO-MAP).
