NRP1,YDL167C,AEP3,YPL005W,,Positive Genetic,high-throughput,Bait,,,,BioGRID,Wilmes GM, et al. (2008) PMID:19061648,An Epistatic MiniArray Profile (E-MAP) analysis was used to quantitatively score genetic interactions based on fitness defects estimated from the colony size of double versus single mutants.  Genetic interactions were considered significant if they had an S score > 2.5 for positive interactions (suppression)  and S score < -2.5 for negative interactions (synthetic sick/lethality).,

NRP1,YDL167C,HTA1,YDR225W,,Positive Genetic,high-throughput,Hit,,,,BioGRID,Libuda DE and Winston F (2010) PMID:20139344,A synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis was performed to identify deletions that either increase or decrease/eliminate the viability of an hta1 htb1 double mutant.  Since HTA2 -HTB2 gene amplification is required for survival in an hta1 htb1 double mutant background, the level of survival of the triple mutant served as an indicator of the frequency of HTA2-HTB2 amplification.,
